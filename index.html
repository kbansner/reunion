My best memories are these: I loved talking to other students in the print drying room of the photo lab about how they made their amazing pictures. I laughed the most while erecting clay pots on the wheel, and throwing clay at friends erecting taller pots. Taking pictures for the yearbook was a gift; it was a perfectly valid excuse riding the bus with the girls volleyball team on away games.</h5>

(He had some sort of seating assignments and my seat happened to be closest to hers). Her friendship is still a blessing to me 30+ years later.</h5>

Now I am blessed to live on beautiful Cape Cod with my husband and 3 children (ages 11, 9 and 7) and am a stay at home mom though somewhere in there I graduated medical school, traveled the world, learned how to ski in my 40s after spending a year (maybe 2) on the bunny slope, and sang a solo live on stage thereby liberating myself from one of my greatest fears.</h5>

					q1: "Thank you to everyone who have worked hard to put together this 30th reunion! I'm sorry to miss it as I'm getting ready to help my middle son move into college as a freshman. I hope you all have an amazing time!",
					q2: "In high school, I was more reserved and wish I had gotten to know more of my peers. It's great to read about what everyone is doing now and seeing all the pictures. I loved being on the tennis team though, living in Berkeley, and working on weekends at Berkeley Bowl for a Chinese family that owned the deli and meat shop.",
					q3: "I'm now living in New York and am married with 3 kids. I was a stay-at-home mom for 15 years- we lived in Japan and England for a total of 9 years, and I learned the value of getting to know people and different cultures from around the world. Their stories are fascinating. I did some freelance writing and then 6 years ago, I discovered my passion as a group fitness and indoor cycling instructor.",
					q4: "I'm not sure what might surprise you all about me, but what surprised me was how I've met some really cool people in high school, but due to circumstances and relocation at the time, I was not able to continue the friendships. 25+ years later, it's wonderful to be reconnected to some of them and see what awesome, inspiring people they've turned out to be. I hope you all will continue to keep well and stay awesome, too!"

					q2: "In high school, I was talking too much and not listening enough, playing sports and wearing baseball caps. (Ironically, I did not wear a Giants cap!) I spent much of my time at school with a small close group of friends, whom I don't see often enough these days.",
					q3: "My wife and I live in the Bay Area, where we are raising our children. I miss Berkeley and try to visit my parents who still live in the house where I grew up as often as possible.",
					q4: "If people would stop throwing cigarette butts out of their cars while driving.....An open, honest political debate that focuses on issues, ideas and vision.....That the A's/Raiders will both stay in Oakland....Hope to see you soon!"
