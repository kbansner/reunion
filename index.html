My best memories are these: I loved talking to other students in the print drying room of the photo lab about how they made their amazing pictures. I laughed the most while erecting clay pots on the wheel, and throwing clay at friends erecting taller pots. Taking pictures for the yearbook was a gift; it was a perfectly valid excuse riding the bus with the girls volleyball team on away games.</h5>

I've brought the Berkeley ethos to wherever I have lived and felt stronger because of it.</h5>
